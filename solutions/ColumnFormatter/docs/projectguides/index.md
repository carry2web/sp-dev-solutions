# Project guides

> If you're looking for how to **use** or **install** Column Formatter, then just jump straight to the [documentation](../documentation/docs/index.md).

The following guides are available for this project. If you're looking for information on how to contribute or build it yourself, then these will help you get started.

The guides aren't to make it harder to submit contributions, rather it's to make sure we can understand and process them as quickly as possible. **We want your contributions!** Reach out with any questions about this process, it's more of a guide than a list of rules.

- **[Minimal Path to Awesome](./mpa.md)** - How to setup your development environment _(build it yourself!)_
- **[Contributing](./contributing.md)** - What you need to know about contributing _(please do!)_
- **[Submitting a PR](./submitting-pr.md)** - How to submit a Pull Request _(send us your contributions!)_
